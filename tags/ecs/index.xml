          These past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with AWS ECS Fargate and after losing some time tackling different approaches I thought it might be useful to write down what I ended up building.
My goal was trying to build an AWS ECS Fargate cluster and deploy apps on it using Azure DevOps Pipelines and I had 3 clear objectives I wanted to achieve.
 All the infrastructure in AWS must be created using IaC (infrastructure-as-code) and must be created using an Azure DevOps pipeline.
