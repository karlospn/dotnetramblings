          GitOps is a term introduced by WeaveWorks a few years ago (https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request)
GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment. The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository.
If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else.

          Today I want to try to use Terraform to automate the app registration process in Azure Active Directory.
If you want to secure an application Azure Active Directory is a really good option, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to configure my application on AAD manually, what I really want is to add a step in my CI / CD pipeline that does that for me, and for that purpose Terraform might be a good option.

          Nowadays no one on his right mind is going to create a WCF from scratch. It really makes no sense to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s a deprecated technology, it does not work with .NET Core, only works on Windows OS and personally I found the configuration confusing as hell, every time I need to modify an existing one I have to spend a good amount of time trying to figure out what everything means.
