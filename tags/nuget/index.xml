          Let&amp;rsquo;s go for a quick post this time.
You are trying to create a Docker image from an app, that application is using some custom Nugets.
Those Nugets are hosted in your private Azure DevOps Feed.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty confident that some of these errors are going to sound pretty familiar to you when you try to build the image:
/src/MyConsoleApplication.csproj : error NU1101: Unable to find package MyOwn.EmailService. No packages exist with this id in source(s): nuget.
