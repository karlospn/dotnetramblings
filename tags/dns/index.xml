          The purpose of this post is to try out the new Azure DNS Private Resolver resource. To test it, we&#39;re going to try to solve one of the current issues that Azure VPN has right now: when connected over an Azure P2S VPN the private DNS zone resolution does not work. This becomes quite problematic when you&#39;re using private endpoints to secure some private resources, because there is no easy way to resolve the private endpoint DNS when connected to a P2S VPN.
