          Just show me the code
As always if you donâ€™t care about the post I have upload the source code on my Github.
 In today&amp;rsquo;s post I want to talk about how you can secure a .NET graphQL API using Azure Active Directory (AAD).
If you want to build a graphQL API in .NET right now, the most well-known options available are the graphQL.NET implementation (https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/) and the HotChocolate one (https://chillicream.

If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about my writings I have upload the code on my Github
 On today&amp;rsquo;s post I want to try to automate the setup of an Azure DevOps organization using the Azure DevOps Terraform provider.
 You might also be interested in these post I wrote a few months ago about automating the AAD App Registration process using the Terraform Azure Active Directory provider.

          These past years I worked with a few companies that uses Azure Active Directory to perform authentication and authorization on their line-of-business (LOB) applications and from time to time I get questions about how to register apps on AAD.
Those questions are always pretty similar and most of the time the problem lies in some misconception, so I thought it might be a good idea to try to answer some of them and at the same time write them down in this post.

          &amp;gt; Updated content:
I wrote the original post almost 6 months ago and since then the AAD Terraform provider has been updated several times.
When I wrote the post I used the version 0.11 and right now the provider is on version 1.1.1, that&amp;rsquo;s a considerable version bump so some people asked me if I could update this post.
Without further ado let&amp;rsquo;s rebuild this example using the 1.1.1 version.
