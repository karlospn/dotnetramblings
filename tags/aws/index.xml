          The dotnet-monitor tool is an alternative to the .NET CLI diagnostic tools. In this post I&#39;ll show you how to deploy a .NET 6 application into AWS ECS Fargate with dotnet-monitor as a sidecar container, and afterwards how you can profile an app using the dotnet-monitor HTTP API.

          This is a 2 part-series post. In part 2 I’ll show you how to build and configure properly a few distributed .NET apps that will send traces to the AWS OTEL Collector, and also how to analyze those traces in AWS X-Ray.

          Vulnerability scanning allows us to review the security state of the container images and take actions to fix issues identified during the scan, resulting in more secure deployments. In this post I will be covering how you can use some of the most well-known scanners alongside with your Azure DevOps CI/CD YAML Pipelines.

          Lately I&#39;ve been deploying a sizable amount of gRPC services to AWS ECS so I thought it might be useful to talk a little bit about some gotchas I have encountered. Some of the problems I&#39;ll be talking about on this post are specific of the .NET implementation of gRPC and another ones are from the AWS side.

          These past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been tinkering with AWS ECS Fargate and after losing some time tackling different approaches I thought it might be useful to write down what I ended up building, so without further ado let&#39;s dig in.
