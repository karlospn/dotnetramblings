          Deploying infrastructure as code on Azure using Azure Pipelines and Terraform requires a minimal bootstrap process. This process can be done manually, but you&#39;ll have to do it every time you want to start deploying resources into a new subscription. So, having some kind of automation seems the way to go here. And that&#39;s exactly what I want to show in this post, how to programmatically bootstrap an Azure subscription and an Azure DevOps project to start deploying Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.
