          Just show me the code
As always if you donâ€™t care about the post I have upload the source code on my Github.
 SonarQube is one of the most well-known code review tools in the dotnet space. It is used mainly to detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your codebase and it can be integrated with any workflow to enable a continuous code inspection across multiple branches and pull requests.

          Let&amp;rsquo;s go for a quick post this time.
Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re trying to create a Docker image from an application and it is using some custom nugets. Those custom nugets are hosted in your private Azure DevOps Feed. And when you try to build the image you get one of the following errors:
/src/MyConsoleApplication.csproj : error NU1101: Unable to find package MyOwn.EmailService. No packages exist with this id in source(s): nuget.org Failed to restore /src/MyConsoleApplication.
