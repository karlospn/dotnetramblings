          The purpose of this post is to test the App Registration process using the latest version of the Terraform provider for Microsoft Entra ID. To achieve this, we&#39;re going to register multiple apps on Microsoft Entra ID and make them interact with each other using a couple of different OAuth2 authorization flows.

          Keeping your container registry free of stale or unwanted images is a task that often gets overlooked when beginning working with containers in the enterprise. In this post, I want to show you how you can use ACR Tasks to automate this process when working with Azure Container Registry.

          This post is going to walk you through the options available when we want to create or update a service on Azure using Terraform, but it is not available on the AzureRM Terraform provider.

          The purpose of this post is to try out the new Azure DNS Private Resolver resource. To test it, we&#39;re going to try to solve one of the current issues that Azure VPN has right now: when connected over an Azure P2S VPN the private DNS zone resolution does not work. This becomes quite problematic when you&#39;re using private endpoints to secure some private resources, because there is no easy way to resolve the private endpoint DNS when connected to a P2S VPN.

      <title>How to bootstrap Terraform and Azure DevOps to start deploying your infrastructure as code to Azure</title>

          Deploying infrastructure as code on Azure using Azure Pipelines and Terraform requires a minimal bootstrap process. This process can be done manually, but you&#39;ll have to do it every time you want to start deploying resources into a new subscription. So, having some kind of automation seems the way to go here. And that&#39;s exactly what I want to show in this post, how to programmatically bootstrap an Azure subscription and an Azure DevOps project to start deploying Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.
