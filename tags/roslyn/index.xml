          In these past few years Microsoft has kept a steady flow of new .NET Core versions: .NETCore 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and so on and so forth.
If you have hundreds of applications in your company it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to keep them updated to the most recent version of the framework, so most probably you&amp;rsquo;re going to end up having multiple versions running at the same time.
When trying to choose which versions are you going to support in your company a factor to consider is that only a few of those versions are long-time support (LTS).
