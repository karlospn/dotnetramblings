          If you only care about the end result, I upload the final result in this GitHub repository: github-link
This repository contains the entire blog source code.
In the &amp;quot;/infrastructure&amp;quot; folder you can find an ARM template that is used to create the static web app.
In the /.github/workflows folder you can find a couple of github actions:
 The infrastructure.yml file is a github action that creates the resources on Azure.

          Do you want to start a blog and don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose a lot of time setting everything up?
That was exactly my thought! I wanted to build a blog to write about my ramblings, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend long hours settings things up.
After doing a little of research about what options are available nowadays I found that Hugo could be a good fit.
What&amp;rsquo;s Hugo? Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator, it is written in Golang and it relies on markdown files and I like how few steps you need to do to have a site ready to rock.
