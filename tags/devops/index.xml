          Introduction First of all let me tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m huge proponent of Terraform as a framework for defining infrastructure in code. One of the things that I like most about Terraform is that not only every major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) offers their own provider but each day more and more companies are starting to offer their own Terraform providers, and those are great news because with Terraform I can create almost any cloud infrastructure that I want and also a huge array of varied resources such as: VMware vSphere Virtual Machines, RabbitMq Queues, Grafana dashboards amongst many many others.
