          This is a 2 part-series post. In part 2 I’ll show you how to build and configure properly a few distributed .NET apps that will send traces to the AWS OTEL Collector, and also how to analyze those traces in AWS X-Ray.

          If you&#39;re using containers quite probably you&#39;re doing the build, test and analysis steps inside the Dockerfile, and setting up the SonarQube scanner when building the image can be a little more cumbersome than usual, and that&#39;s why I wanted to write a little bit about it.

          Lately I&#39;ve been deploying a sizable amount of gRPC services to AWS ECS so I thought it might be useful to talk a little bit about some gotchas I have encountered. Some of the problems I&#39;ll be talking about on this post are specific of the .NET implementation of gRPC and another ones are from the AWS side.

          OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. On today&#39;s post I&#39;m going to show you how you can start using OTEL and distributed tracing with .NET Core.

          Roslyn Analyzers are extensions that analyze source code and report violations. Some analyzers are built-into VS and some are third party ones which can be installed (like StyleCopyAnalyzers, FxCopAnalyzers, etc.). On today&#39;s post I will show you how you can configure your custom roslyn analyzers with an .editorconfig file.

          In these past few years Microsoft has kept a steady flow of new .NET Core versions, and if you have hundreds of applications in your company it&#39;s almost impossible to keep them updated to the most recent version of the framework. If you want to enforce that everyone on your company is using the correct framework version when they create a new application you can use a Roslyn Analyzer.
