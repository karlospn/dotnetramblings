If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the post I have upload the code on my Github
 I already talked in some of my post about AWS CDK, but for those unaware of AWS CDK is a framework that allows us to define cloud infrastructure in code.
AWS CDK is available in a bunch of different languages:
 JavaScript TypeScript Python Java .NET Core  I already shared my thoughts about AWS CDK in some of my older posts so in this one I will cut to the chase and I will focus on showing you some of the options available when you want to deploy a .

          These past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with AWS ECS Fargate and after losing some time tackling different approaches I thought it might be useful to write down what I ended up building.
My goal was trying to build an AWS ECS Fargate cluster and deploy apps on it using Azure DevOps Pipelines and I had 3 clear objectives I wanted to achieve.
 All the infrastructure in AWS must be created using IaC (infrastructure-as-code) and must be created using an Azure DevOps pipeline.

          Introduction First of all let me tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m huge proponent of Terraform as a framework for defining infrastructure in code. One of the things that I like most about Terraform is that not only every major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) offers their own provider but each day more and more companies are starting to offer their own Terraform providers, and those are great news because with Terraform I can create almost any cloud infrastructure that I want and also a huge array of varied resources such as: VMware vSphere Virtual Machines, RabbitMq Queues, Grafana dashboards amongst many many others.
